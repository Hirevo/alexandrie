# How to contribute

Thanks for reading this! 

## Bugs/Feature Requests/Questions

You can submit bug reports, feature requests, and questions to
[issue tracker](https://github.com/JohnTitor/termize).

## Submitting changes

You can submit patches as a pull request. The commit title should start with
the base verb whose first letter is a capital letter.

We follow no merge policy. You should resolve merge conflicts by rebase,
not merge.

## Coding conventions

  * Use four spaces (not hard tabs) on Rust files(*.rs)
  * Use two spaces (not hard tabs) on other files basically
  * Run clippy and rustfmt before submitting pull requests if possible
