Securely zero memory while avoiding compiler optimizations.

This crate implements a portable approach to securely zeroing memory using
techniques which guarantee they won't be "optimized away" by the compiler.

The [`Zeroize` trait] is the crate's primary API.

[Documentation]

## About

[Zeroing memory securely is hard] - compilers optimize for performance, and
in doing so they love to "optimize away" unnecessary zeroing calls. There are
many documented "tricks" to attempt to avoid these optimizations and ensure
that a zeroing routine is performed reliably.

This crate isn't about tricks: it uses [core::ptr::write_volatile]
and [core::sync::atomic] memory fences to provide easy-to-use, portable
zeroing behavior which works on all of Rust's core number types and slices
thereof, implemented in pure Rust with no usage of FFI or assembly.

- No insecure fallbacks!
- No dependencies!
- No FFI or inline assembly! **WASM friendly** (and tested)!
- `#![no_std]` i.e. **embedded-friendly**!
- No functionality besides securely zeroing memory!
- (Optional) Custom derive support for zeroing complex structures

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

Requires Rust **1.39** or newer.

In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied
with a minor version bump.
