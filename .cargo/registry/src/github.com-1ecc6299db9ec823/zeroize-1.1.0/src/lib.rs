//! Securely zero memory with a simple trait ([Zeroize]) built on stable Rust
//! primitives which guarantee the operation will not be "optimized away".
//!
//! ## About
//!
//! [Zeroing memory securely is hard] - compilers optimize for performance, and
//! in doing so they love to "optimize away" unnecessary zeroing calls. There are
//! many documented "tricks" to attempt to avoid these optimizations and ensure
//! that a zeroing routine is performed reliably.
//!
//! This crate isn't about tricks: it uses [core::ptr::write_volatile]
//! and [core::sync::atomic] memory fences to provide easy-to-use, portable
//! zeroing behavior which works on all of Rust's core number types and slices
//! thereof, implemented in pure Rust with no usage of FFI or assembly.
//!
//! - No insecure fallbacks!
//! - No dependencies!
//! - No FFI or inline assembly! **WASM friendly** (and tested)!
//! - `#![no_std]` i.e. **embedded-friendly**!
//! - No functionality besides securely zeroing memory!
//! - (Optional) Custom derive support for zeroing complex structures
//!
//! ## Minimum Supported Rust Version
//!
//! Requires Rust **1.39** or newer.
//!
//! In the future, we reserve the right to change MSRV (i.e. MSRV is out-of-scope
//! for this crate's SemVer guarantees), however when we do it will be accompanied
//! with a minor version bump.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ```
//! use zeroize::Zeroize;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // Protip: don't embed secrets in your source code.
//!     // This is just an example.
//!     let mut secret = b"Air shield password: 1,2,3,4,5".to_vec();
//!     // [ ... ] open the air shield here
//!
//!     // Now that we're done using the secret, zero it out.
//!     secret.zeroize();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The [Zeroize] trait is impl'd on all of Rust's core scalar types including
//! integers, floats, `bool`, and `char`.
//!
//! Additionally, it's implemented on slices and `IterMut`s of the above types.
//!
//! When the `alloc` feature is enabled (which it is by default), it's also
//! impl'd for `Vec<T>` for the above types as well as `String`, where it provides
//! [Vec::clear()] / [String::clear()]-like behavior (truncating to zero-length)
//! but ensures the backing memory is securely zeroed with some caveats.
//! (NOTE: see "Stack/Heap Zeroing Notes" for important `Vec`/`String` details)
//!
//! The [DefaultIsZeroes] marker trait can be impl'd on types which also
//! impl [Default], which implements [Zeroize] by overwriting a value with
//! the default value.
//!
//! ## Custom Derive Support
//!
//! This crate has custom derive support for the `Zeroize` trait,
//! gated under the `zeroize` crate's `zeroize_derive` Cargo feature,
//! which automatically calls `zeroize()` on all members of a struct
//! or tuple struct.
//!
//! Additionally it supports the following attribute:
//!
//! - `#[zeroize(drop)]`: call `zeroize()` when this item is dropped
//!
//! Example which derives `Drop`:
//!
//! ```
//! use zeroize::Zeroize;
//!
//! // This struct will be zeroized on drop
//! #[derive(Zeroize)]
//! #[zeroize(drop)]
//! struct MyStruct([u8; 32]);
//! ```
//!
//! Example which does not derive `Drop` (useful for e.g. `Copy` types)
//!
//! ```
//! use zeroize::Zeroize;
//!
//! // This struct will *NOT* be zeroized on drop
//! #[derive(Copy, Clone, Zeroize)]
//! struct MyStruct([u8; 32]);
//! ```
//!
//! ## `Zeroizing<Z>`: wrapper for zeroizing arbitrary values on drop
//!
//! `Zeroizing<Z: Zeroize>` is a generic wrapper type that impls `Deref`
//! and `DerefMut`, allowing access to an inner value of type `Z`, and also
//! impls a `Drop` handler which calls `zeroize()` on its contents:
//!
//! ```
//! use zeroize::Zeroizing;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let mut secret = Zeroizing::new([0u8; 5]);
//!
//!     // Set the air shield password
//!     // Protip (again): don't embed secrets in your source code.
//!     secret.copy_from_slice(&[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
//!     assert_eq!(secret.as_ref(), &[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
//!
//!     // The contents of `secret` will be automatically zeroized on drop
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## What guarantees does this crate provide?
//!
//! This crate guarantees the following:
//!
//! 1. The zeroing operation can't be "optimized away" by the compiler.
//! 2. All subsequent reads to memory will see "zeroized" values.
//!
//! LLVM's volatile semantics ensure #1 is true.
//!
//! Additionally, thanks to work by the [Unsafe Code Guidelines Working Group],
//! we can now fairly confidently say #2 is true as well. Previously there were
//! worries that the approach used by this crate (mixing volatile and
//! non-volatile accesses) was undefined behavior due to language contained
//! in the documentation for `write_volatile`, however after some discussion
//! [these remarks have been removed] and the specific usage pattern in this
//! crate is considered to be well-defined.
//!
//! Additionally this crate leverages [compiler_fence] from
//! [core::sync::atomic] with the strictest ordering ([Ordering::SeqCst])
//! as a precaution to help ensure reads are not reordered before memory has
//! been zeroed.
//!
//! All of that said, there is still potential for microarchitectural attacks
//! (ala Spectre/Meltdown) to leak "zeroized" secrets through covert channels.
//! This crate makes no guarantees that zeroized values cannot be leaked
//! through such channels, as they represent flaws in the underlying hardware.
//!
//! ## Stack/Heap Zeroing Notes
//!
//! This crate can be used to zero values from either the stack or the heap.
//!
//! However, be aware several operations in Rust can unintentionally leave
//! copies of data in memory. This includes but is not limited to:
//!
//! - Moves and `Copy`
//! - Heap reallocation when using `Vec` and `String`
//! - Borrowers of a reference making copies of the data
//!
//! [`Pin`][pin] can be leveraged in conjunction with this crate to ensure
//! data kept on the stack isn't moved.
//!
//! The `Zeroize` impls for `Vec` and `String` zeroize the entire capacity of
//! their backing buffer, but cannot guarantee copies of the data were not
//! previously made by buffer reallocation. It's therefore important when
//! attempting to zeroize such buffers to initialize them to the correct
//! capacity, and take care to prevent subsequent reallocation.
//!
//! The `secrecy` crate provides higher-level abstractions for eliminating
//! usage patterns which can cause reallocations:
//!
//! <https://crates.io/crates/secrecy>
//!
//! ## What about: clearing registers, mlock, mprotect, etc?
//!
//! This crate is focused on providing simple, unobtrusive support for reliably
//! zeroing memory using the best approach possible on stable Rust.
//!
//! Clearing registers is a difficult problem that can't easily be solved by
//! something like a crate, and requires either inline ASM or rustc support.
//! See <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/17046> for background on
//! this particular problem.
//!
//! Other memory protection mechanisms are interesting and useful, but often
//! overkill (e.g. defending against RAM scraping or attackers with swap access).
//! In as much as there may be merit to these approaches, there are also many
//! other crates that already implement more sophisticated memory protections.
//! Such protections are explicitly out-of-scope for this crate.
//!
//! Zeroing memory is [good cryptographic hygiene] and this crate seeks to promote
//! it in the most unobtrusive manner possible. This includes omitting complex
//! `unsafe` memory protection systems and just trying to make the best memory
//! zeroing crate available.
