//! The work-stealing executor.
//!
//! Tasks created by [`Task::spawn()`] go into this executor. Every thread calling [`run()`]
//! initializes a [`Worker`] that participates in work stealing, which is allowed to run any task in
//! this executor or in other workers. Since tasks can be stolen by any worker and thus move from
//! thread to thread, their futures must implement [`Send`].
//!
//! There is only one global instance of this type, accessible by [`WorkStealingExecutor::get()`].
//!
//! [Work stealing] is a strategy that reduces contention in multi-threaded environments. If all
//! invocations of [`run()`] used the same global task queue all the time, they would contend on
//! the queue all the time, thus slowing the executor down.
//!
//! The solution is to have a separate queue for each invocation of [`run()`], called a "worker".
//! Each thread is primarily using its own worker. Once all tasks in the worker are exhausted, then
//! we look for tasks in the global queue, called "injector", or steal tasks from other workers.
//!
//! [`run()`]: crate::run()
