us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and

frustration later on.

### Getting familiar with the project

**The architecture** is somewhat unique, it was originally inspired by [XML pull parsers](http://www.xmlpull.org), but ended up going in somewhat its own direction. to get familiar with it, 
- start my reading the [README](README.md) page, which gives some details on the design of the parser (pull-based events) and some rationalization for it ;
- read the [blog post](https://fullyfaithful.eu/pulldown-cmark) about the release of Pulldown-cmark 0.3 by Marcus Klaas de Vries.

**The source code** can be approached by skimming the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark) first, then explore the code for the main struct, [`Parser`](https://docs.rs/pulldown-cmark/latest/pulldown_cmark/struct.Parser.html)

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
