The `rustc_ast` crate contains those things concerned purely with syntax
â€“ that is, the AST ("abstract syntax tree"), parser, pretty-printer,
lexer, macro expander, and utilities for traversing ASTs.

For more information about how these things work in rustc, see the
rustc dev guide:

- [Macro Expansion](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/macro-expansion.html)
