handlebars-rust
===============

[Handlebars templating language](https://handlebarsjs.com) implemented
in Rust and for Rust.

Handlebars-rust is the template engine that renders the official Rust website
[rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org), [its
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) ~~and official repository [crates.io](https://crates.io)~~.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```rust
extern crate handlebars;
#[macro_use]
extern crate serde_json;

use handlebars::Handlebars;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let mut reg = Handlebars::new();
    // render without register
    println!(
        "{}",
        reg.render_template("Hello {{name}}", &json!({"name": "foo"}))?
    );

    // register template using given name
    reg.register_template_string("tpl_1", "Good afternoon, {{name}}")?;
    println!("{}", reg.render("tpl_1", &json!({"name": "foo"}))?);
    Ok(())
}
```

### Code Example

If you are not familiar with [handlebars language
syntax](https://handlebarsjs.com), it is recommended to walk through
their introduction first.

Check the `render` example in the source tree. The example shows you how
to:

* Create a `Handlebars` registry and register the template from files;
* Create a custom Helper with closure or struct implementing
 `HelperDef`, and register it;
* Define and prepare some data;
* Render it;

Run `cargo run --example render` to see results
(or `RUST_LOG=handlebars=info cargo run --example render` for logging
output).

Checkout `examples/` for more concrete demos of the current API.


## Minimum Rust Version Policy

Handlebars will track Rust nightly and stable channel. When dropping
support for previous stable versions, I will bump **minor** version
and clarify in CHANGELOG.

## Why (this) Handlebars?

Handlebars is a real-world templating system that you can use to build
your application without pain.

### Features

#### Isolation of Rust and HTML

This library doesn't attempt to use some macro magic to allow you to
write your template within your rust code. I admit that it's fun to do
that but it doesn't fit real-world use cases.

#### Limited but essential control structure built-in

Only essential control directives `if` and `each` are built-in. This
prevents you from putting too much application logic into your template.

#### Extensible helper system

You can write your own helper with Rust! It can be a block helper or
inline helper. Put your logic into the helper and don't repeat
yourself.

A helper can be as a simple as a Rust function like:

```rust
handlebars_helper!(hex: |v: i64| format!("0x{:x}", v));

/// register the helper
handlebars.register_helper("hex", Box::new(hex));
```

And using it in your template:

```handlebars
{{hex 16}}
```

With `script_helper` feature flag enabled, you can also create helpers
using [rhai](https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai) script, just like JavaScript
for handlebars-js. This feature was in early stage. Its API was limited at the
moment, and can change in future.

#### Template inheritance

Every time I look into a templating system, I will investigate its
support for [template
inheritance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/language/#template-inheritance).

Template include is not sufficient for template reuse. In most cases
you will need a skeleton of page as parent (header, footer, etc.), and
embed your page into this parent.

You can find a real example of template inheritance in
`examples/partials.rs` and templates used by this file.

#### WebAssembly compatible

Handlebars 3.0 can be used in WebAssembly projects.
