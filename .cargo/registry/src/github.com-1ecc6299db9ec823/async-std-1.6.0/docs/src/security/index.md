# Security

Writing a highly perfomant async core library is a task involving some instances of unsafe code.

We take great care in vetting all unsafe code included in `async-std` and do follow generally accepted practices.

In the case that you find a security-related bug in our library, please get in touch with our [security contact][security-policy].

Patches improving the resilience of the library or the testing setup are happily accepted on our [github org][github].
